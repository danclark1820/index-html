        <p style="font-size:16px; font-family:Verdana;">My name is Daniel Clark. I am a 23 years old. I just graduated this past December from the University of Delaware with B.S. in Mechanical Engineering. My interest in becoming a developer came from a desire to have a job where I get to do creative and technical work. I would like to spend my career perfecting a craft. I believe a career in software developement could be platform to learn, work on creative solutions, and be a part of of building impactful products. My degree gave me an appreciation for quality design. In order to design something well you have to define a clear scope, develop concepts, create a prototype, and finally validate your design. This process is highly iterative, and never over. I love my degree, and I am glad I had the oppurtunity for a higher learning experience. But I would point out one comparison to myself if I could go back and speak to my younger self when deciding on a major. A mechanical engineering degree at the beginning of the industrial revolution is the equivalent to a computer science degree today.  I believe <a href= "http://ebookbrowsee.net/marc-andreessen-on-why-software-is-eating-the-world-pdf-d265803950">"software is eating the world"</a> to quote Marc Andreseen.  The fact that we are at the advent of an information age is obvious.  While mechanical engineering design is moving forward with great velocity, information design is accelerating forward. I spent last summer teaching myself to code in hopes that I could get to a entry job level proficciency by the time I finished college. It was a great experience, I learned a lot, but there were pitfalls. I experienced signifigant scope creep without deadlines and a clear direction.  I did not end the summer with portfolio to show to employers, to get me that first position where I could further grow from.  I have a passion for technology and building. My background has given me an appreciation for great design and  elegant mathmatics, with a patience to tinker until I get it right. I believe Launch Academy would be an excellent launch point for a career in software development. </p>
